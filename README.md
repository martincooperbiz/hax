## About the project

This tool is expertly designed for ethical hacking, using intelligent cyber attack simulations to identify successful outcomes. It uploads results to the cloud for advanced data analytics, refining models for future attacks.

The implemented attacks are:

- CrossSite Scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection (SQLi)

## How do I get set up?

Feel free to clone the repository and create your own version of the application. However, kindly note that the source code is licensed under the `GPL-3.0 license`. To learn more about the license and its terms, please refer to the complete license documentation available [here](./LICENSE).


### Deployment prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure to meet the following requirements:
_**Note**: Those steps are working for both macOS, and Linux_

- Download and install python latest version, [check here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install pip, [check here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
- Install TKinter `brew install python-tk` or `make install-tk`. _**Note**: You need to have brew installed_.
- Set up a Python Virtual Environment (venv) by executing `make create-env` and then switch to the newly created venv using the command: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`. It's worth noting that the `make` command automatically installs the necessary libraries listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). If you prefer using your local environment instead of venv, you can achieve the same by running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries.
- The entry point is [./hax/main.py](./hax/main.py), You can start the application by running `make run` or `python3 ./hax/main.py`.
